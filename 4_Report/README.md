Introduction:
Stepper motor is a brushless DC motor that divides the full rotation angle of 360° into a number of equal steps.

The motor is rotated by applying a certain sequence of control signals. The speed of rotation can be changed by changing the rate at which the control signals are applied.
Various stepper motors with different step angles and torque ratings are available in the market.
A microcontroller can be used to apply different control signals to the motor to make it rotate according to the need of the application.

Abstract:
The microcontroller based stepper motor control system controls the motor and any motor device according to its requirement for any industrial application. At the heart of the circuit is the AT mega 32 microcontroller which controls all its functions. The stepper motor can move a precise angle; the motor’s position can be controlled without any feedback mechanism. Microcontroller can be used to apply different control signals to the motor to make it rotate according to the need of application. In this paper, we are going to rotate a stepper motor by using an AT mega 32 microcontroller. AT mega 32 has been programmed in order to rotate the stepper motor for various applications. The motor drive which acts as an interface between the microcontroller and the stepper motor. The microcontroller board is applying the external voltage of about 5V. From this it can be directly deliver the input to the stepper motor drive where it provides sufficient current to the stepper motor which tends to rotate the stepper motor. By programming the stepper drive, we can be able to control the speed of the stepper motor, direction of the stepper motor either in clockwise or anticlockwise direction. Motor drive protects the stepper motor from damages so that the stepper motor drive can be connected between the stepper motor and AT mega 32 microcontroller
