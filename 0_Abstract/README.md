      Stepper Motor Interfacing With AVR ATmega 32




The microcontroller based stepper motor control system controls the motor and any motor device
according to its requirement for any industrial application. At the heart of the circuit is the AT mega 32
microcontroller which controls all its functions. The stepper motor can move a precise angle; the motorâ€™s
position can be controlled without any feedback mechanism. Microcontroller can be used to apply different
control signals to the motor to make it rotate according to the need of application. In this paper, we are going
to rotate a stepper motor by using an AT mega 32 microcontroller. AT mega 32 has been programmed in
order to rotate the stepper motor for various applications. The motor drive which acts as an interface between
the microcontroller and the stepper motor. The microcontroller board is applying the external voltage of
about 5V. From this it can be directly deliver the input to the stepper motor drive where it provides sufficient
current to the stepper motor which tends to rotate the stepper motor. By programming the stepper drive, we
can be able to control the speed of the stepper motor, direction of the stepper motor either in clockwise or
anticlockwise direction. Motor drive protects the stepper motor from damages so that the stepper motor drive
can be connected between the stepper motor and AT mega 32 microcontroller
